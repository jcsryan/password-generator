# password-generator
a random password generator

The following JS logic pulls from four existing strings and concatenates them into a single larger string depending on the users choice. The logic then pulls, at random, from this larger string to create the password. I chose this way of doing the assignemnt because the code was the simplest and most easily understood of the three ways in which I got the generator to work. 

The first and second versions of JS logic I created are in the file other logics, they both work when linked up to the HTML file.
Here is the chosen logic.
